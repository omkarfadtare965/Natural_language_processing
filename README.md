RNN (Recurrent neural network):
What is RNN? Where and why is it used? Teach me RNN architecture in detail and the simplest words possible.
What is the issue with ANN that we can not use it for sequential data? Why RNNs work best on sequential data? 
How does forward and backward propagation in RNN occur?
What is sequential and non-sequential data?
Is there any specific input format for RNNs? that is (timesteps, input features)? What is timestep here? show me with an example. 
In keras the input fromat will be (batch size, timestep. input features) How to decide timestep? while coding do we need to decide timestep? or is there anything elese that i am missing out?
 WHy it is called recurrent neural network
What is unfolding through time?
What is return_sequence = False parameter in RNN
What are the types of RNN like Many to many one to one, many to one, and one to many exaplin in breif what is the difference in between all these may be with an example
